- implement linear regression with gradient descent from scratch
  - work in groups, but repeat the exerecise individually later
  - make a new github repo called "Linear-Regression-From-Scratch"
  - don't add any fancy normalisation, mini-batching 
  - start by creating a skeleton of the code  
    - we want to create an sklearn-like class for a linear regression model
    - define the class
    - define the methods you expect it to need, but dont fill them in yet, just put `pass` inside
      - which magic method will you need to define to start with?
      - which methods do our sklearn models usually have?
      - what other pieces of the code might you be able to group together inside a method?
      - which of these will be "private" methods?
        - how does that affect their names?
  - now below that class, code up how you expect the class to be used
    - how will an instance be created?
    - how will it be fit to the data?
    - how will predictions be made?
  - run your code. Yes, before you've defined the method bodies! Does it work? 
    - it's easier to debug as you go as your code is simpler
    - Lucky you checked now right!
    - make a git commit
  - now comment the inside of the functions roughly what will happen in each line
  - now implement the methods, starting with the easiest methods first
    - continue to run your code to test it works as intended
      - don't be scared to put all kind of print statements in to debug
      - remember to keep git committing
    - anything strange happening? message me. It might make for a good demo.
  - save the gradient computation until last, and take special care here
  - refer to the pdf notes to find the gradients
  - graph the loss against each iteration
  - discuss: does it look good? 
    - What else could it have looked like?
    - How would you dealt with different graph appearances?
  - now you've done the simple implementation, add normalisation and compare your results
  - now you've done that, add mini-batching and compare your results
  - push this to github and tidy up the readme
