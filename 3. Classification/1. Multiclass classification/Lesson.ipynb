    "\n",
    "- increasing the value of any entry decreases the value of all of the others, because the whole vector must always sum to one. \n",
    "- an increase in one input element increases it's corresponding output element exponentially whilst pushing others down, \n",
    "- this means that __it is very easy for the one largest output element to become dominant__\n",
    "- because of that `softmax` is overconfident and there are ways to combat this like `label smoothing`\n",
    "\n",
    "### What does the name \"softmax\" mean?\n",
    "\n",
    "- as explained above, usually one input is near `1`, and all others close to `0`. That is, similar to the `argmax` operation mentioned previously but \"soft\" as it can be differentiated.\n",
    "- `argmax` changes abruptly, small difference between two values make it either `0` or `1`. Softmax on the other hand changes gradually when the maximum changes\n",
